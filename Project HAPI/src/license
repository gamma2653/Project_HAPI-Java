This tool may be used, and only used, in the ways explicitly stated below.

DEVELOPERS:
  Anyone can use this tool, reference this tool, and post the source code anywhere they feel. However,
  you can not change the code and distribute it for profit (excluding advertisements from websites) unless you have digital or
  physical permission from the author. You may use the code for any application you desire (again, not for money but ads are allowed).

FORMS OF PERMISSION:
  Permission may be in the following forms, but are NOT limited to:
    -Valid Email
    -Valid Image
    -Valid Written Signature
  In general, anything that shows proof that the author did in fact give this person permission should be allowed.

USERS:
  I am not to be held liable for any damage caused to hardware/software. Anyone who has made changes to the application are not to be held
  liable either. Any changes you make to the tool is to your own risk.

MY RIGHTS:
  I have the right to revoke permission, in which you may no longer publish any more content I have previously given permission for, as
  for anything already published, they shall remain as they were.

Informal Summary (Not to be taken literally in the case of the court, where the word end is is where the official license has ended.)

This license allows the author to have full control over anyone who can make money off of your tool (excluding ads). It also states that users
may use this license and that no one who worked on the tool is to be held responsible. It also allows any developer to use the tool for any free
products, but to release their product at a price they require a form of permission.

Enjoy!
